## Big Science - Automated Classification & Dataset Curation - AC/DC

This is the data filtering code for BigScience.

See [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bx7lzAIWALH2IX5PLAiRfkHr3025dC-ZYkEmq4zB2gI/edit) for more details.

The supported languages are defined in the file [languages_id.py](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/data_tooling/blob/master/ac_dc/languages_id.py).


### Filtering

#### 0. Understand the filtering pipeline

Take a look at the pdf [explanation_filtering_pipeline.pdf](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/data_tooling/blob/master/ac_dc/explanation_filtering_pipeline.pdf) for an explanation of the filtering pipeline.

#### 1. Define the lists of stop words and flagged words, and check how the anonymization and the normalization of texts are done

You might want to redefine the lists of stop words and flagged words for robustness or ethical reasons in the files [stopwords.py](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/data_tooling/blob/master/ac_dc/stopwords.py) and [flagged_words.py](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/data_tooling/blob/master/ac_dc/flagged_words.py).

Less importantly, you can also check how the anonymization and the normalization of texts are done in the files [anonymization.py](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/data_tooling/blob/master/ac_dc/anonymization.py) and [normalization.py](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/data_tooling/blob/master/ac_dc/normalization.py) (if applicable, default is to use the anonymization and not to use the normalization).

#### 2. Download everything you need

To run the filtering code, it is necessary to download the dataset on which the filtering will take place, but also the necessary models, which are the Fasttext model for language identification (download [here](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/supervised-models/lid.176.bin)) and the Sentencepiece and KenLM models for tokenization and calculation of perplexity scores (download with the file [download_sentencepiece_kenlm_models.py](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/data_tooling/blob/master/ac_dc/download_sentencepiece_kenlm_models.py)).

#### 3. Choose the filtering parameters

The filtering parameters for each language are to be specified in the file [parameters_filtering.py](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/data_tooling/blob/master/ac_dc/parameters_filtering.py). It is strongly recommended to look at the data and use the visualization code in the directory [visualization](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/data_tooling/tree/master/ac_dc/visualization) to choose these parameters.

#### 4. Run the filtering

Run the filtering with the file [main_filtering.py](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/data_tooling/blob/master/ac_dc/main_filtering.py), specifying the dataset used and the links to the downloaded models. The different filters are coded in the file [filtering.py](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/data_tooling/blob/master/ac_dc/filtering.py).

#### 5. Do the deduplication

Do the deduplication, which is detailed in the following section, with the file [deduplicate.py](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/data_tooling/blob/master/ac_dc/deduplicate.py).


### Deduplication

#### 0. Sharding a dataset

We want to shard a dataset into multiple shards so that each node on HPC can take a shard and each shard can be further parallelized with CPU cores.

```bash
python ac_dc/deduplicate.py create-shards "cache/sharded" 5 --path "oscar-corpus/OSCAR-2109" --name "deduplicated_af" --split "train"
# or
python ac_dc/deduplicate.py create-shards "cache/sharded" 5 --path "oscar-corpus/OSCAR-2109" --name "deduplicated_af" --data-dir "local path to data directory" --split "train"
```

It loads a local dataset and segments its `train` split into 5 shards/sub-datasets under `cache/sharded`. This gives you
```
cache/sharded
├── sharded_00000.jsonl
├── sharded_00001.jsonl
├── sharded_00002.jsonl
├── sharded_00003.jsonl
└── sharded_00004.jsonl
```

#### 1. Create Simhashes
```bash
# run each command on each node
python ac_dc/deduplicate.py build-hashes "cache/deduplicated_af_hashes_00001" --data-files "sharded_00000.jsonl" --data-files "sharded_00001.jsonl" --path "cache/sharded" --split "train"
python ac_dc/deduplicate.py build-hashes "cache/deduplicated_af_hashes_00002" --data-files "sharded_00002.jsonl" --data-files "sharded_00003.jsonl" --path "cache/sharded" --split "train"
python ac_dc/deduplicate.py build-hashes "cache/deduplicated_af_hashes_00003" --data-files "sharded_00004.jsonl" --path "cache/sharded" --split "train"
```
The above commands add an addition column `hash` in the data and outputs two datasets at `cache/en_hashes_00001` and `cache/en_hashes_00002`. This is useful for large dataset and each node/worker can hash some shards of the data in parallel.

#### 2. Create a Simhash Index
```bash
python ac_dc/deduplicate.py build-index "cache/deduplicated_af_simhash_index.ann" "cache/deduplicated_af_hashes_00001" "cache/deduplicated_af_hashes_00002" "cache/deduplicated_af_hashes_00003" --split "train"
```
This creates the index file based on ALL the hashed datasets. This is a merge step and takes O(n) time.

#### 3. Find Duplicates
```bash
# run each command on each node
LOG_LEVEL="INFO" python ac_dc/deduplicate.py find-duplicates "cache/deduplicated_af_hashes_00001" "cache/deduplicated_af_simhash_index.pkl" --split "train" --k 100 --threshold 3
LOG_LEVEL="INFO" python ac_dc/deduplicate.py find-duplicates "cache/deduplicated_af_hashes_00002" "cache/deduplicated_af_simhash_index.pkl" --split "train" --k 100 --threshold 3
LOG_LEVEL="INFO" python ac_dc/deduplicate.py find-duplicates "cache/deduplicated_af_hashes_00003" "cache/deduplicated_af_simhash_index.pkl" --split "train" --k 100 --threshold 3
```
This adds another column `duplicates` into the data with the index and outputs them into `cache/en_hashes_0000{1,2,3}_duplicates`.

#### 4. Remove Duplicates
```bash
python ac_dc/deduplicate.py remove-duplicates "cache/deduplicated_af_hashes_00001_duplicates" "cache/deduplicated_af_hashes_00002_duplicates" "cache/deduplicated_af_hashes_00003_duplicates" --split "train"
```
This removes all duplicates from the given datasets and outputs `cache/en_hashes_0000{1,2,3}_deduplicated`; Partially parallelized because thre is a step finding connected components of duplicates and it takes O(n) time.

#### 5. Merge Shards
```bash
python ac_dc/deduplicate.py merge-shards "cache/simhash_deduplicated_af" "cache/deduplicated_af_hashes_00001_deduplicated" "cache/deduplicated_af_hashes_00002_deduplicated" "cache/deduplicated_af_hashes_00003_deduplicated" --split "train"
```
This merges all shards back into one dataset.
